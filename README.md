# Google clone for the Odin project

First exercise of the Foundations course from the Odin Project.

## Cool things I learned

- You can get the favicon.ico of Google and many websites if you search it at the root of the domain.
e.g. [www.google.com/favicon.ico](https://www.google.com/favicon.ico)
There are also other [alternatives for extracting .ico.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5119041/how-can-i-get-a-web-sites-favicon)
- Made a good setup of extensions in VsCode, some of the most helpful for me in this project: [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [className Completion in CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zitup.classnametocss).
- The Odin Project recommends [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/), and they're so worth it, I definitely recommend them too.
- The standard for [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) this project uses this type of commits.
- [You cannot do css selector grouping for two child selectors with the same parent.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6192596/how-to-select-multiple-elements-that-are-children-of-given-element) A shame, I really thought it was possible.
